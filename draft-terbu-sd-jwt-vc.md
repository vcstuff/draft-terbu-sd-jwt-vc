# Introduction

## Three-Party-Model

In the so-called Three-Party-Model, Issuers issue Verifiable Credentials to a
Holder, who can then present the Verifiable Credentials to Verifiers. Verifiable
Credentials are cryptographically signed statements about a Subject, typically the Holder.

Figure: Three-Party-Model with optional Status Provider

Verifiers can check the authenticity of the data in the Verifiable Credentials
and optionally enforce Holder Binding, i.e., ask the Holder to prove that they
are the intended holder of the Verifiable Credential, for example, by proving possession of a
cryptographic key referenced in the credential. This process is further
described in [@!I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt].

To support revocation of Verifiable Credentials, an optional fourth party can be
involved, a Status Provider, who delivers revocation information to Verifiers.
(The Verifier can also serve as the Status Provider.)

This specification defines Verifiable Credentials based on the SD-JWT
format with a JWT Claim Set.

## Rationale

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) [@!RFC7519] can in principle be used to express
Verifiable Credentials in a way that is easy to understand and process as it
builds upon established web primitives. While JWT-based credentials enable selective
disclosure, i.e., the ability for a Holder to disclose only a subset of the contained
claims, in an Identity Provider ecosystem by issuing new JWTs to the Verifier for
every presentation, this approach does not work in the three-party-model.

Selective Disclosure JWT (SD-JWT) [@!I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt] is
a specification that introduces conventions to support selective disclosure for
JWTs: For an SD-JWT document, a Holder can decide which claims to release (within
bounds defined by the Issuer). This format is therefore perfectly suited for
Verifiable Credentials.

SD-JWT itself does not define the claims that must be used within the payload or
their semantics. This specification therefore defines how Verifiable Credentials
can be expressed using SD-JWT.

JWTs (and SD-JWTs) can contain claims that are registered in "JSON Web Token Claims"
registry as defined in [@!RFC7519], as well as public and
private claims. This specification aims to express metadata of the properties of the
Verifiable Credentials utilizing registered JWT claims, while allowing Issuers to use
other registered, public, or private claims to make statements about the Subject of the
Verifiable Credential.

## Requirements Notation and Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [@!RFC2119].

## Terms and Definitions

This specification uses the terms "Holder", "Issuer", "Verifier", defined by
[@!I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt].

Verifiable Credential (VC):
:  An Issuer-signed assertion with claims about a Subject.

SD-JWT-based Verifiable Credential (SD-JWT VC):
: A Verifiable Credential encoded using the Issuance format defined in
[@!I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt].

Unsecured payload of an SD-JWT VC:
: A JSON object containing all selectively disclosable and non-selectively disclosable claims
of the SD-JWT VC. The unsecured payload acts as the input JSON object to issue
an SD-JWT VC complying to this specification.

Status Provider:
: An entity that provides status information (e.g. revocation) about a Verifiable Credential.

# Scope

* This specification defines
  - Data model and media types for Verifiable Credentials based on SD-JWTs.
  - Validation and processing rules for Verifiers and Holders.

# Use Cases

TBD: explain use cases of the three-party-model.

TBD: conventional crypt, hardware security, hsm, mobile secure area,
compliance with FIPS

# Verifiable Credentials based on SD-JWT

This section defines encoding, validation and processing rules for SD-JWT VCs.

## Media Type

SD-JWT VCs compliant with this specification MUST use the media type
`application/vc+sd-jwt` as defined in (#application-vc-sd-jwt).

## Data Format

SD-JWT VCs MUST be encoded using the SD-JWT Combined Format for Issuance as
defined in Section 5.3. of [@!I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt].

SD-JWT VCs MUST contain all Disclosures corresponding to their SD-JWT component
except for Decoy Digests as per Section 5.1.1.3. of [@!I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt].

### Header Parameters

This section defines JWT header parameters for the SD-JWT component of the
SD-JWT VC.

The `typ` header parameter of the SD-JWT MUST be present. The `typ` value MUST
use `vc+sd-jwt`. This indicates that the payload of the SD-JWT contains plain
JSON and follows the rules as defined in this specification. It further
indicates that the SD-JWT is a SD-JWT component of a SD-JWT VC.

The following is a non-normative example of a decoded SD-JWT header:

```
{
  "alg": "ES256",
  "typ": "vc+sd-jwt"
}
```

### Claims

This section defines the claims that can be included in the payload of
SD-JWT VCs.

#### `type` claim {#type-claim}

This specification defines the JWT claim `type`. The `type` claim is used
to express the type of the JSON object that is secured by the
JWT. The `type` value MUST be a case-sensitive `StringOrURI` value.

The following is a non-normative example of how `type` is used to express
a type:

```
{
  "type": "SomeType"
}
```

#### Registered JWT Claims

SD-JWT VCs MAY use any claim registered in the "JSON Web Token Claims"
registry as defined in [@!RFC7519].

If present, the following registered JWT claims MUST be included in the SD-JWT
and MUST NOT be included in the Disclosures, i.e. cannot be selectively
disclosed:

* `iss`
    * REQUIRED. The Issuer of the Verifiable Credential. The value of `iss`
MUST be a URI. See [@!RFC7519] for more information.
* `iat`
    * REQUIRED. The time of issuance of the Verifiable Credential. See
[@!RFC7519] for more information.
* `nbf`
    * OPTIONAL. The time before which the Verifiable Credential MUST NOT be
accepted before validating. See [@!RFC7519] for more information.
* `exp`
    * OPTIONAL. The expiry time of the Verifiable Credential after which the
Verifiable Credential is no longer valid. See [@!RFC7519] for more
information.
* `cnf`
    * REQUIRED when Cryptographic Holder Binding is to be supported. Contains the confirmation method as defined in [@!RFC7800]. It SHOULD contain a JWK as defined in Section 3.2 of [@!RFC7800] and in this case, the `kid` (Key ID) member MUST be present in the JWK.  For Cryptographic Holder Binding, the Holder Binding JWT in the Combined Format for Presentation MUST be signed by the key identified in this claim.
* `type`
    * REQUIRED. The type of the Verifiable Credential, e.g.,
`IdentityCredential`, as defined in (#type-claim).
* `status`
    * OPTIONAL. The information on how to read the status of the Verifiable
Credential. See [TBD] for more information.

The following registered JWT claims MAY be contained in the SD-JWT or in the
Disclosures and MAY be selectively disclosed:

* `sub`
    * OPTIONAL. The identifier of the Subject of the Verifiable Credential.
The Issuer MAY use it to provide the Subject
identifier known by the Issuer. There is no requirement for a binding to
exist between `sub` and `cnf` claims.

#### Public JWT claims

Additional public claims MAY be used in SD-JWT VCs depending on the
application.

## Example

The following is a non-normative example of an unsecured payload of an
SD-JWT VC.

<{{examples/01/user_claims.json}}

The following is a non-normative example of how the unsecured payload of the
SD-JWT VC above can be used in a SD-JWT where the resulting SD-JWT VC contains
only claims about the Subject that are selectively disclosable:

<{{examples/01/sd_jwt_payload.json}}

Note that a `cnf` claim has been added to the SD-JWT payload to express the
confirmation method of the holder binding.

The following are the Disclosures belonging to the SD-JWT payload above:

{{examples/01/disclosures.md}}

The SD-JWT and the Disclosures would then be serialized by the Issuer into the following format for issuance to the Holder:

<{{examples/01/combined_issuance.txt}}

## Verification and Processing {#vc-sd-jwt-verification-and-processing}

The recipient of the SD-JWT VC MUST process and verify an SD-JWT VC as
follows:

 1. REQUIRED. Process and verify the SD-JWT as defined in
Section 6. of [@!I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt]. For the
verification, the `iss` claim in the SD-JWT MAY be used to retrieve the public
key from the JWT VC Issuer Metadata configuration (as defined in
(#jwt-vc-issuer-metadata)) of the SD-JWT VC issuer. A Verifier MAY use alternative
methods to obtain the public key to verify the signature of the SD-JWT.
 1. OPTIONAL. If `status` is present in the verified payload of the SD-JWT,
the status SHOULD be checked. It depends on the Verifier policy to reject or
accept a presentation of a SD-JWT VC based on the status of the Verifiable
Credential.

Any claims used that are not understood MUST be ignored.

Additional validation rules MAY apply, but their use is out of the scope of
this specification.

# JWT VC Issuer Metadata {#jwt-vc-issuer-metadata}

This specification defines the JWT VC Issuer Metadata to retrieve the JWT Issuer
Metadata configuration of the JWT Issuer of the JWT. The JWT Issuer is
identified by the `iss` claim in the JWT. Use of the JWT VC Issuer Metadata
is OPTIONAL.

JWT Issuers publishing JWT VC Issuer Metadata MUST make a JWT VC Issuer Metadata
configuration available at the path formed by concatenating the string
`/.well-known/jwt-vc-issuer` to the `iss` claim value in the JWT. The `iss` MUST
be a case-sensitive URL using the HTTPS scheme that contains scheme, host and,
optionally, port number and path components, but no query or fragment
components.

## JWT VC Issuer Metadata Request

A JWT VC Issuer Metadata configuration MUST be queried using an HTTP `GET` request
at the path defined in (#jwt-vc-issuer-metadata).

The following is a non-normative example of a HTTP request for the JWT Issuer
Metadata configuration when `iss` is set to `https://example.com`:

```
GET /.well-known/jwt-vc-issuer HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

If the `iss` value contains a path component, any terminating `/` MUST be
removed before inserting `/.well-known/` and the well-known URI suffix
between the host component and the path component.

The following is a non-normative example of a HTTP request for the JWT Issuer
Metadata configuration when `iss` is set to `https://example.com/user/1234`:

```
GET /.well-known/jwt-issuer/user/1234 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

## JWT VC Issuer Metadata Response

A successful response MUST use the `200 OK HTTP` and return the JWT Issuer
Metadata configuration using the `application/json` content type.

An error response uses the applicable HTTP status code value.

This specification defines the following JWT VC Issuer Metadata configuration
parameters:

* `issuer`
      REQUIRED. The JWT Issuer identifier, which MUST be identical to the `iss`
value in the JWT.
* `jwks_uri`
    * OPTIONAL. URL string referencing the JWT Issuer's JSON Web Key (JWK) Set
[@RFC7517] document which contains the JWT Issuer's public keys. The value of
this field MUST point to a valid JWK Set document. Use of this parameter is
RECOMMENDED, as it allows for easy key rotation.
* `jwks`
    * OPTIONAL. JWT Issuer's JSON Web Key Set [@RFC7517] document value, which
contains the JWT Issuer's public keys. The value of this field MUST be a JSON
object containing a valid JWK Set. This parameter is intended to be used by JWT
Issuer that cannot use the `jwks_uri` parameter.

JWT VC Issuer Metadata MUST include either `jwks_uri` or `jwks` in their JWT
Issuer Metadata, but not both.

It is RECOMMENDED that the JWT contains a `kid` JWT header parameter that can
be used to lookup the public key in the JWK Set included by value or referenced
in the JWT VC Issuer Metadata.

The following is a non-normative example of a JWT VC Issuer Metadata configuration
including `jwks`:

```
{
   "issuer":"https://example.com",
   "jwks":{
      "keys":[
         {
            "kid":"doc-signer-05-25-2022",
            "e":"AQAB",
            "n":"nj3YJwsLUFl9BmpAbkOswCNVx17Eh9wMO-_AReZwBqfaWFcfG
   HrZXsIV2VMCNVNU8Tpb4obUaSXcRcQ-VMsfQPJm9IzgtRdAY8NN8Xb7PEcYyk

            "kty":"RSA"
         }
      ]
   }
}
```

The following is a non-normative example of a JWT VC Issuer Metadata
configuration including `jwks_uri`:

```
{
   "issuer":"https://example.com",
   "jwks_uri":"https://jwt-vc-issuer.example.org/my_public_keys.jwks"
}
```

Additional JWT VC Issuer Metadata configuration parameters MAY also be used.

## JWT VC Issuer Metadata Validation

The `issuer` value returned MUST be identical to the `iss` value of the JWT. If
these values are not identical, the data contained in the response MUST NOT be
used.

# Presenting Verifiable Credentials

This section defines encoding, validation and processing rules for presentations
of SD-JWT VCs.

## Data Format

A presentation of an SD-JWT VC MUST be encoded using the SD-JWT Combined
Format for Presentation as defined in Section 5.4. of
[@!I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt].

A presentation of an SD-JWT VC MAY contain a Holder Binding JWT as described in
Section 5.4.1. of [@!I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt].

### Holder Binding JWT

If the presentation of the SD-JWT VC includes a Holder Binding JWT, the
following claims are used within the Holder Binding JWT:

* `nonce`
    * REQUIRED. String value used to associate a transaction between a Verifier
an a Holder, and to mitigate replay attacks. The value is passed
through unmodified from the Verifier to the Holder Binding JWT. Sufficient
entropy MUST be present in the `nonce` values used to prevent attackers from
guessing values.
* `aud`
    * REQUIRED. The intended recipient of the Holder Binding JWT which is
typically the Verifier. See [@!RFC7519] for more information.
* `iat`
    * REQUIRED. The time of issuance of the Holder Binding JWT. See
[@!RFC7519] for more information.
* `exp`
    * OPTIONAL. The expiration time of the signature when
the Holder Binding is no longer considered valid. See [@!RFC7519]
for more information.

The Holder Binding JWT MAY include addtional claims which when not understood
MUST be ignored.

## Examples

The following is a non-normative example of a presentation of the SD-JWT shown
above including a Holder Binding JWT:

<{{examples/01/combined_presentation.txt}}

In this presentation, the Holder provides only the Disclosure for the claim
`address`. Other claims are not disclosed to the Verifier.

The following example shows a presentation of a (different) SD-JWT without a
Holder Binding JWT:

<{{examples/02/combined_presentation.txt}}

## Verification and Processing {#vp-sd-jwt-verification-and-processing}

The Verifier MUST process and verify a presentation of SD-JWT VC as follows:

 1. REQUIRED. When processing and verifying the presentation of the SD-JWT VC,
the Verifier MUST follow the same verification and processing rules as defined
in (#vc-sd-jwt-verification-and-processing).
 1. OPTIONAL. If provided, the Verifier MUST verify the Holder Binding JWT
according to Section 6.2. of [@!I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt].
To verify the Holder Binding JWT, the `cnf` claim of the SD-JWT MUST be used.

# Security Considerations {#security-considerations}

TBD: Verifier provided `nonce`.

# Privacy Considerations {#privacy-considerations}
